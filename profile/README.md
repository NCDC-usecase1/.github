# MRI-based and metabolomics-based age scores act synergetically for mortality prediction shown by multi-cohort federated learning
This is a collection of all the code used to run the experiments, and create the figures/tables for our paper called 'MRI-based and metabolomics-based age scores act synergetically for mortality prediction shown by multi-cohort federated learning' ([paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01235)). This consists of the following repositories:

- [Federated BrainAge](https://github.com/NCDC-usecase1/federated-brain-age)
- [Vantage6 infrastructure node extension](https://github.com/NCDC-usecase1/ncdc-memorabel)
